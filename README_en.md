# tpre-python

This project is designed for the National Cryptography Competition and is implemented in Python to execute the TPRE algorithm.

## Project Principle

The project uses the Chinese national standard cryptography algorithm to implement distributed proxy re-encryption (TPRE).

## Environment Dependencies

System requirements:  
- Linux
- Windows

The project relies on the following software:  
- Python 3.11
- gmssl
- gmssl-python

## Installation Steps

### Pre-installation
This project depends on gmssl, so you need to compile it from source first.
